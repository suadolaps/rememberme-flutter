# Remember Me
A spiritual journey journal which helps (young) Muslims develop and nurture a relationship with God through verses of the Quran. 
User selects a theme and each day, a verse of the Quran related to the theme is displayed on the home page. Each verse has a related “ponder” (showing ways in which verse relates to their daily life) and a reflection or action prompt, with the option to write a journal entry recording their thoughts. 

Other features include:
- Ability to add a maximum of 2 other users (buddies) for accountability purpose. Users can ‘budge’ their buddies, sending them reminders to complete their journal entries. 
- A reward system, where users get badges and can level up, the more consistent they are with journalling.

An overview of the design for individual screens can be found [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/871acea6-4249-45a6-ae88-c27273fa5292-d249/). 

## Demo 
A screencast of the app running can be found [here]().

## Architecture 
The app architecture detailing how the mobile client interacts with the backend can be found [here](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/5d6cd919-3d82-4ada-b7e9-5c2cfc588227/0_0).

## Set up
The Flutter documentation provides a [detailed tutorial](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on how to set up a development environment for flutter applications depending on your operating system. 
- Once set up, create a new folder and navigate into the folder from the terminal with command `mkdir <folder-name> && cd <folder-name>`
- Clone the GitHub repo into the folder:
    - Over HTTPS: `$ git clone https://gitlab.com/remember-me-app/rememberme-flutter.git`
    - Over SSH: `$ git clone git@gitlab.com:remember-me-app/rememberme-flutter.git`
- Open the project folder using your preferred code editor 
- Run the command `flutter pub get` from the terminal to get necessary packages and assets into the project folder 
- Start up a device simulator, ensure its selected and run the command `flutter run`
You can now interact with the app, explore and make changes.
